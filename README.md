- 👋 Hi, I’m @ImJuanBer, I'm an amateur in programming, fully interested in develop software, I'm currently designing proyects for engineering, so, I'm open for anyone who wants
      to start a kind of proyect about engineering or anything that includes Pyqt5
      
- 👀 I’m interested in:
          - Learn about how to be a better designer and implement the best techniques for my apps
          - Learn about Enginnering apps.
          - {Learn about Scikit, Tensorflow, Keras, and other libraries for Machine Learning} ---> Goal
          
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Pyqt5 with QtDesigner for my engineering app to design LV transformers, also I'm studying Pandas, Matplotlib and Femm for finite elements to
      develop better tools and then calculate impedance, heat gradients and other important variables that companies ask for.
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who have knowledges about PyQt5 and engineering aplications.
